# MediSightAI--Zero-shot-Diagnosis-System

The project, 'MediSightAI', is a zero-shot diagnostic assistant built with Streamlit. It analyzes user-uploaded medical images (e.g., X-rays) in two ways: 1) It performs zero-shot classification against a user-defined list of conditions using the `microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT` model. 2) It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to find and display similar historical cases from a knowledge base stored in a ChromaDB vector database. The knowledge base is built by indexing images from a local directory, cleverly using filename parsing to generate descriptive labels. The application is well-structured, separating the UI (`app.py`), the AI model (`src/model.py`), the RAG engine (`src/rag.py`), and utilities (`src/utils.py`).
